we used bootstrap, bcrypt, express, express-session, handlebars, mongodb, multer, and xss sanitization.

to get things up and running, first get mondgo running on your computer. run "npm i" in the directory, then "npm run seed" to seed data, and then "npm run start" to get the server running. head over to localhost:3000 to use the platform.
